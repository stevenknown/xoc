ELF Reader And Writer
==============

The directory contain a module to read ELF information and write information into ELF binary file.
This module requires other standard libraries that located in xcom.

There is a demo under the example directory to show how to use the module.
The demo is actually the readelf.exe and I believe it is very useful to help you integrate the module into your project.
